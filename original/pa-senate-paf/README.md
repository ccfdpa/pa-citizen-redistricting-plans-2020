## Citizen Submissions to LRC

Two plans, indicated in the list below, were missing a 0 population precinct in the water area of Lake Erie. For both plans all precincts on the shore of Lake Erie were assigned to District 1, so the missing precinct was also assigned to District 1. This has a big impact on the compactness of District 1, but puts these plans on a level playing field with all other proposed House redistricting plans and the adopted plan.

This plan was downloaded as a precinct assignment file from <https://www.redistricting.state.pa.us/comment/submission/481> (<https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::65288e8c-68ef-494b-a299-4a05e95a4f58>). For unknown reasons, five of the districts have an "R" or "D" before the district number, which interfered with the analysis software we used. This folder contains the plan as originally submitted.
