## Citizen Submissions to LRC

One plan submitted as a precinct assignment file was missing a 0 population precinct in the water area of Lake Erie. This plan was modified to match the LRC proposed plan, which assigned that precinct to District 1. This has a big impact on the compactness of District 1, but puts this plan on a level playing field with all other proposed House redistricting plans and the adopted plan.
